                <h2>John Katona</h2>
                <p>You're on a website that is my full name dot com, so you probably have some idea who I am...<br><br>
                    But, in case you don't, I'm a full time engineer at GM, but my wife is music.  
                    I write, record, and produce music out of my studio home. My passion is for unique sounds and instruments, including my large collection of
                    analog synthesizers, toy instruments, and vintage gear.  When I produce, I don't use sample libraries or soft-synth, but prefer to record and sample everything
                    myself for a totally unique sound.  I love to collaborate and make music with new people, so if you'd like to make music with me, please reach
                    out and introduce yourself. <br><br>
