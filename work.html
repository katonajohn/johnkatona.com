                <p>Co-writer | Producer | Mixing Engineer<br>
                    This is a collaboration project with singer/songwriter Ohly and me.  I wrote the music 10 years ago, but with Ohly's help, we're breathing new life into it.<br>
                Release set for February 2021.</p>

                <h2>Ryan Trager | Floodlight</h2>
                <p>Producer | Mixing Engineer<br>
                    Ryan is one of the best guitarists I know (and a former guitar teacher).  It was so much fun working with him late at night, after his son went to bed.  He is a perfectionist and I'm really proud of the results because of it.  His lyrics are both personal and honest, yet meticulously edited and perfected.  He also introduced me to the Detroit Folk scene (The Ghostlight in Hamtramck).  Two of the highlights were recording with "Dobro Dave" and Emilie Rivard.</p>

                        Christian Ohly was not even old enough to drink when we made this record.  He was naturally so talented, but he let me repeatedly say, "can we get one more?"  Since, we've become good friends, and we started the band Bird Fight together.<br><br></p>

                <p>Co-writer | Producer | Mixing Engineer<br>
                    I met Ian Cassidy in a coffee shop after awkwardly making eye-contact twice.  Besides being a loyal and close friend, he was extremely talented as a writer and performer.  We played many shows and made lots of music together before he passed away much too young. This is our only song we released together.</p>

                <p>Co-writer | Co-producer<br>
                    I'm 1/3 of this band.  This was a single and video that was very fun to make.  And a few of the lyrics are things an ex told me, but she doesn't know.</p>

                <p>Co-writer | Co-producer<br>
                    I'm 1/3 of this band.  This was our debut record.  Aside from vocals, it was completely recorded with windows sound recorder, arguably the worst recording software ever created.</p>

                    This is a little 4 song EDM EP I made, then sold to MTV for very little money.</p>

                                Tim's brain works so differently than mine.  To me, he talks in metaphor when describing his music or what he wants, but then when we get to what he wants, it ends up really cool.
